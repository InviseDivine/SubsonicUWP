# Privacy Policy for SubsonicUWP

**Last updated:** January 27, 2026

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application **SubsonicUWP** ("Application") for Windows 10/11 devices.

## 1. Collection of Data

**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

The Application functions as a client interface to access your personally hosted or third-party hosted Subsonic-compatible music server. 

## 2. Server credentials and Data Transmission

To function, the Application requires you to input the URL, username, and password of your Subsonic server.
*   **Direct-to-Server:** These credentials are used solely to authenticate directly with your specified server. 
*   **No Third-Party Access:** Your credentials, listening history, and music library metadata are **never** transmitted to the developer or any third party. They remain strictly between your device and your personal server.
*   **Local Storage:** Credentials may be stored locally on your device in the secure "Credential Locker" or encrypted local storage to facilitate auto-login, at your discretion.

## 3. Microsoft Store Permissions

The Application requires specific permissions to function on your device. Here is how they are used:

### Internet (Client)
*   **Purpose:** Required to connect to your Subsonic server to fetch artist lists, album metadata, and stream audio files.
*   **Data Shared:** Network requests are made only to the server URL you configure.

### Background Media Playback
*   **Purpose:** Allows the application to continue playing audio when the app is minimized, the screen is locked, or the app is in the background.
*   **Data Shared:** No additional data is shared. This is a system-level function to ensure uninterrupted listening.

### Music Library (Optional)
*   **Purpose:** Required to save downloaded songs for offline playback or to integrate with your device's local media controls.
*   **Data Shared:** The app may read/write files in its designated storage area or your Music library folder for the sole purpose of caching/downloading media you request.

## 4. Analytics

This Application **does not** use any third-party analytics SDKs (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior. Crash reports, if generated by the Windows operating system, may be available to the developer via the Microsoft Partner Center which are anonymized and used solely for bug fixing.

## 5. Contact Information

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us.
